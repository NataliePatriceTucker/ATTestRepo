#[Assistive Technology Conformance Test Repository] (https://attestrepo.azurewebsites.net/)

There are 40 design patterns described in the W3C's [ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/). In order to understand how different screen reader/browser combinations interpret them, often a great deal of trial and error, exploration, and research is required.  By building this respository we intend to aggregate and present our findings on the conformance of NVDA + Firefox and Narrator/ NVDA + Edge as well as solicit contributions by the web accessibility community to continually update and expand this resource.
